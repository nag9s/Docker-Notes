If you'd like to run Docker without`sudo`, it's best to add your user to the`docker`group using the below command:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

in Unix/Linux distributions, the command ‘_usermod _‘ is used to modify or change any attributes of a already created user account via command line.

The command ‘_usermod_‘ is similar to that ‘useradd‘ or ‘adduser‘ but the login granted to an existing user.
