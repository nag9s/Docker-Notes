The following command runs an`ubuntu`container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs`/bin/bash`.

```
$ docker run -i -t  ubuntu /bin/bash
```

When you run this command, the following happens \(assuming you are using the default registry configuration\):

1. If you do not have the`ubuntu`image locally\( remember this is still exists as image in registery - image is nothing but a template file - which was the reason you see some thing like pull complete , download complete as the templat file structured in layers\) Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run`docker pull ubuntu`manually.

2. Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a`docker container create`command manually.

3. Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem.

4. Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you did not specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machineâ€™s network connection.

5. Docker starts the container and executes`/bin/bash`. Because the container is run interactively and attached to your terminal \(due to the`-i`and`-t`\) flags, you can provide input using your keyboard and output is logged to your terminal.

6. When you type`exit`to terminate the`/bin/bash`command, the container stops but is not removed. You can start it again or remove it.
